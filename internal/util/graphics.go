// This file stands in for Graphics.cs from CustomClasses/Utilities/Graphics.cs.
// Since the Go version of the tool is CLI-only, most rendering helpers are not
// required and are intentionally left unimplemented.

// TODO: if some graphical calculations (but not actual drawing) are needed,
// they can be added here as pure functions.
